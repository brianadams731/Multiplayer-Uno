                    <p>To begin a game of UNO, first register your user by clicking the <b>Register</b> button in the
                        navbar.<br>
                        You will be automatically logged in upon successful registration and redirected to the user
                        dashboard.<br>
                        From here, you can either choose to create a game or join an existing game from a list of
                        available game <br>
                        lobbies. Some lobbies will require a password, so if you are looking to join one of these
                        lobbies, be sure <br>
                        to request the password from the game lobby creator!
                    </p>

                    <h1 class="game-rules-header">Game Rules</h1>
                    <p>At the start of every game, all players will be dealt five cards face-down. The
                        first player will be granted<br>the option of playing any card they wish! In case you wish to
                        remind yourself on whose turn it is, the<br>list of players on the top left of the screen will have
                        a single player name highlighted to show<br>whose turn it is currently! To play a valid card on
                        your turn,
                        you must ensure the card you wish to<br>play matches the current top card's color or value (ex. if
                        the current
                        top card is a red 2, then you will<br>be able to play any card that is red or a 2 of any color).
                        UNO also has special cards with special<br>effects. Click the next page in the bottom button list
                        to learn more about these special cards!

                    <h1 class="game-rules-header">Special Cards</h1>
                    <p>When you are playing, you will notice there exists 5 different special cards outside of the
                        generic
                        0-9 numeric cards. Here's what they do:
                    <ol>
                        <li class="special-cards-rules"><b>Draw Two Cards:</b>
                            If you play the draw two card, you will force the player whose turn
                            it is next to draw two cards to their hand.
                        </li>
                        <li class="special-cards-rules"><b>Skip Cards:</b>
                            If you play the skip card, the player whose turn it is next will have
                            their turn skipped!
                        </li>
                        <li class="special-cards-rules"><b>Reverse Cards:</b>
                            If you play the reverse card, the turn order will be reversed!
                        </li>
                        <li class="special-cards-rules"><b>Wild Cards:</b>
                            If you play the wild card, you can choose which color you want to be
                            played from the next turn onwards! The wild card is<br>unique in that you can play it
                            disregarding the need to match the color or value of the card currently at the top of the
                            discard pile!
                        </li>
                        <li class="special-cards-rules"><b>Wild Draw Four Cards:</b>
                            If you play the wild draw four card, you can choose which color
                            you want to be played<br>from the next turn onwards AND force the following player to draw four
                            cards to their hand! The<br>wild draw four card is similar to the wild card in that you can
                            play it disregarding the need to<br>match the color or value of the card currently at the top
                            of the discard pile!
                        </li>
